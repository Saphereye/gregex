# Gregex Logic
Contains the underlying logic of the Gregex crate. This crate is responsible for converting the Node tree to the NFA. The NFA is then used to match the input string.

The crate uses the [Glushkov's Construction Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glushkov%27s_construction_algorithm) to convert the Node tree to the NFA. The advantage over the Thompson's Construction Algorithm is that the NFA generated has states equal to number of terminals + 1. Although, the NFA generated by Thumpson's can be converted to the Glushkov's form, by removing the epsilon transitions.

The `translation` module contains the code to convert the Node tree to the NFA. The `nfa` module contains the code to match the input string with the NFA.
